# What Is a List?

---

Now that you’ve already worked with **variables**, understanding **lists** becomes much easier.

A **list** in Python is an ordered collection of items stored under a single variable name.  
You can think of a list as a **container** that holds multiple pieces of related data, all in one place.

You can put anything in a list. For example, you might have a list containing all the letters of the alphabet—or, more commonly in real programming, a list holding different pieces of user data. Python even allows you to **mix data types** inside a list.

Here is an example list that stores information in the format:

**Name, Date of Birth, Current Age, Job**

```python
user_data = ["Mark Cavendish", "May 21, 1985", 40, "Professional Cyclist"]
````

If we print this list, Python displays exactly what it contains:

```python
print(user_data)
```

Output:

```shell
["Mark Cavendish", "May 21, 1985", 40, "Professional Cyclist"]
```

Here is a **clean, polished continuation** of your section — matching your style, using **Mark Cavendish’s data**, fixing spelling, and giving **indexing + negative indexing** examples exactly where you left off.

You can copy/paste this directly under your last line (“Now, lets…”).

## List Indexing

**Note: Indexing also works on strings**

Lists are ordered, so Python gives you a simple way to access a specific position: **indexing**.
Before we start, remember: Python starts counting at **0**, not 1.

So for the list:

```python
user_data = ["Mark Cavendish", "May 21, 1985", 40, "Professional Cyclist"]
```

the indexes look like this:

| Index | Value                  |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 0     | "Mark Cavendish"       |
| 1     | "May 21, 1985"         |
| 2     | 40                     |
| 3     | "Professional Cyclist" |

### Accessing Items with Positive Indexes

```python
print(user_data[0])   # "Mark Cavendish"
print(user_data[1])   # "May 21, 1985"
print(user_data[2])   # 40
print(user_data[3])   # "Professional Cyclist"
```

Indexing is extremely common—any time you want a single item from a list, you use square brackets with a number.

## Negative Indexing

Python also supports **negative indexes**, which start counting from the *end* of the list.

| Negative Index | Value                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| -1             | "Professional Cyclist" |
| -2             | 40                     |
| -3             | "May 21, 1985"         |
| -4             | "Mark Cavendish"       |

This makes it very easy to get the last item:

```python
print(user_data[-1])   # "Professional Cyclist"
```

Or the second-to-last item:

```python
print(user_data[-2])   # 40
```

Negative indexing is useful when you don’t know the exact length of the list but you want something from the end.

---

## Note: Indexing Inside a String

Because strings are also sequences, indexing works **inside** string elements too.

```python
name = user_data[0]

print(name[0])     # 'M'
print(name[5])     # 'C'   (the C in "Cavendish")
print(name[-1])    # 'h'   (last letter of last name)
```

# Using Data from a List

Say we want to introduce Mark Cavendish to someone. We can pull data from a list and print it the same way we would with variables.

### Example 1 — Assign each item to a variable

```python
user_data = ["Mark Cavendish", "May 21, 1985", 40, "Professional Cyclist"]

name = user_data[0]
date_of_birth = user_data[1]
age = user_data[2]
occupation = user_data[3]

print(f"{name}, a {occupation}, was born on {date_of_birth} and is {age} years old.")
```

### Example 2 — Access list items directly inside the f-string

```python
user_data = ["Mark Cavendish", "May 21, 1985", 40, "Professional Cyclist"]

print(
    f"{user_data[0]}, a {user_data[3]}, was born on {user_data[1]} and is {user_data[2]} years old."
)
```

Both versions output:

```shell
Mark Cavendish, a Professional Cyclist, was born on May 21, 1985 and is 40 years old.
```
