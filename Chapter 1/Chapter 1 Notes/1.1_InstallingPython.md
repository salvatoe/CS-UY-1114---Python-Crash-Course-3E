# Installing Python

When I say these notes are *introductory*, I really mean it!  
Most Linux systems come with Python already installed, and macOS used to ship with Python as well. However, the preinstalled versions are often outdated — usually **Python 2**, which was released in **2000** and is no longer maintained. Modern programming uses **Python 3** (originally released in 2008 and still actively updated).

To install the latest Python 3 version, download it directly from python.org:

- **macOS:**  
  [Download Python for Mac](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.14.0/python-3.14.0-macos11.pkg)

- **Windows:**  
  [Download Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/pymanager-250/)

After installation, open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
python3 --version
````

or on Windows:

```powershell
py --version
```

You should see a Python 3.x version number.
At the time of writing these notes, the version is 3.14, but versions do get updated periodicaly. The links above will be updated when python 3.15 is released, but any code from here will work with anything bakc to 3.9, so dont worry about constantly updating.
