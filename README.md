# **CS-UY 1114 — Python Crash Course (3rd Edition) Companion (IN PROGRESS)**

*Study Notes & Exercises (IN PROGRESS)*

Notes and exercises based on ***Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition*** by Eric Matthes, created while studying **CS-UY 1114: Intro to Programming & Problem Solving** at NYU Tandon.

## **About This Repository**

This repository contains my personal study notes, rewritten examples, and custom exercises based on **Python Crash Course (PCC3)**.

Although **PCC3 uses a different chapter order** than CS-UY 1114, the **core topics overlap almost perfectly**, including:

* Variables & expressions
* Strings
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Functions
* Lists, tuples, and dictionaries
* File I/O
* Exceptions
* Classes & objects
* Testing
* Basic data structures

This project provides an organized, course-aligned companion to PCC3 for students who want:

* Extra practice beyond official CS-UY 1114 assignments
* Clear explanations and rewritten examples
* A guide showing how PCC3 topics map onto the NYU syllabus
* A reliable reference when reviewing for exams or labs
* A resource for building small Python projects

## **Purpose of This Companion**

While PCC3 is not the official textbook for CS-UY 1114, it is one of the **clearest introductions to Python**.
But its chapter order doesn’t always line up with the NYU course structure.

This repository bridges that gap by:

* Reorganizing PCC3 material into a CS-UY-friendly progression
* Offering simplified explanations for tricky concepts
* Providing annotated code that highlights common beginner mistakes
* Including extra practice exercises modeled after NYU lab exams
* Giving students a peer-written explanation — sometimes easier than a textbook

I struggled with a few early concepts myself, so many of these notes go into **a lot of depth** and explain ideas step-by-step.

## **How This Repo Is Organized**

The structure is intentionally simple:

* **/notes** — Detailed study notes and summaries
* **/examples** — Rewritten PCC3 code examples
* **/homeworks** — AI-generated practice questions based on 1114 homework problems
* **/practice exams** - AI-generated practice questions based on 1114 exams
* **/labs** - AI-generated practice questions based on 1114 labs

Everything is designed to be clear, readable, and student-friendly.

## **Should You Buy PCC3?**

Yes — I personally recommend buying **Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)**.
But if you work through all the notes and exercises in this repo, you will:

* Keep up with CS-UY 1114
* Reinforce key programming concepts
* Prepare effectively for lab exams
* Build confidence writing and debugging Python programs

## **When Should I Use This Repo?**

This companion is meant to be used **any time you want extra support**, especially if you're new to programming.

Here are the best times to use it:

### **✔️ Before the Semester (Summer or Winter Break)**

If you're starting CS-UY 1114 with **0 programming experience**, working through these notes early will give you a massive head start. (I had some
Most students enter 1114 with *some* prior coding exposure — this repo assumes you have **none**.

### **✔️ During the Semester**

Use it while taking the course to:

* Review topics after lecture
* See clearer or simpler explanations
* Prepare for lab exams
* Build confidence through short practice problems

### **✔️ In Your Free Time**

If you want to master Python at your own pace, the examples and exercises here are full beginner-friendly training.

### **✔️ After the Course**

Use it as a refresher when moving into:

* CS-UY 1134 (Data Structures), 2124 (Object Oriented Programing) or any other programming-heavy class
* Personal projects
* Technical interview prep

This repo grows with your skills — the deeper you go into the notes, the more useful it becomes.

## **Status**

This repository is updated continuously as I progress through the course and complete more PCC3 material.
Check back often for new notes, examples, and exercises.
